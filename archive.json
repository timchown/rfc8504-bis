I also investigating what it would take to get Linux distros\r\nto ship with it on by default,  or for the Linux kernel to change it's\r\ndefault.\r\n\r\nWhen investigating this I learn that:\r\n1) few or none of the big properties had it turned on.  They just set their\r\n   TCP (max) segment size to 1400 or some number like that.\r\n\r\n2) this is because TX opportunities were considered scarce, they use TCP\r\n   Segment Offload, so in order to send any probe packets, they would have to\r\n   do something else.\r\n\r\n3) sending 10 1400 byte packets is less expensive than sending 9 1500 byte\r\n   packets, if any of those packets will need to be retransmitted because of\r\n   an MTU issue.\r\n\r\nAs such none of the big properties could provide any evidence that PLPMTU was\r\nnot harmful.\r\n\r\nMaybe it just doesn't matter.  Maybe we should just all set a knob making\r\n~1400 be the largest TCP segment size.  Will we ever get to 9K packets on the\r\nInternet?  Does anyone still want to go there?\"\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\"What about an SSH connection IPv6 at home over VDSL (PPPoE) to some server\r\nwith a 9000 MTU?  Does that work?  I see it fail regularly because PPPoE\r\nusually has a 1480-ish value.\"",
